RAWLS_WIKI = "Alek Rawls, or Doctor Airsoft, is an airsofter residing in the Dallas Area who currently leads the group known as 'Texas Liberation Army.' He is notable for his extreme views and his actions stemming from them and how schitzo he is.\n Notable incidents include: using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate pro-russian/iranian fanfic, which is a greater part of the TLA lore; unfriendly behavior and ultimately breakdown of relations with the Texas chapter of Rushing Russians, and screaming about mature topics to children playing airsoft at the D14 field, which lead to complaints from the parents attending (and an absolutely hilarious aftermath on D14's server).\n Needless to say he is one crazy schitzo.\n\nThis will be updated as time progresses"

GBBR_BITCHING_PASTA = "EMG/Evike and its consequences have been a disaster for the airsofting society. They have greatly increased the variety of aeg replicas for us who live in 'advanced' countries, but they have stagnated realism, have made airsofting unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities (of speedsofters), have led to widespread psychological suffering (HOLY SHIT EVIKE HOW IS INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING FASTER???) and have inflicted severe damage on the product market. The continued lack of development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject airsoft being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the airsoft world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “gun” countries. The greedy corpo-dumb speedsofter system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a level of actually fun and realistic gameplay, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of dumb shit like NGRS and only at the cost of permanently reducing gun lifespans and many other part components to consumers and mere cogs in the economic machine....\n This was a schitzo meme post following the aftermath of a botched evike delivery and flawless redwolf and proact ones"
